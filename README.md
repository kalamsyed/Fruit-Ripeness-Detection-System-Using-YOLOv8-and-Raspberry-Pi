# Fruit-Ripeness-Detection-System-Using-YOLOv8-and-Raspberry-Pi
This project presents a real-time fruit detection and classification system using the YOLOv8 deep learning model on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. It detects fruits like apple, banana, mango, melon, orange, peach, and pear, and classifies them into four quality stages: Fresh, Semifresh, Semirotten, and Rotten.
